# ProTools
Discord ProTools is a BetterDiscord plugin that allows faster and broader usage of the discord GUI.

### Usage
ProTools makes use of the new Ctrl + K quickswitcher dialog. All the commands are typed there. Every command begins with a ":", followed by the command name. If command takes parameters, they are separated by spaces, for example ":guild 0" goes to the first guild.
